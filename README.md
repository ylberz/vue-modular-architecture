# Vue Modular Architecture

## Overview

The `vue-modular-architecture` project introduces a modular approach to organizing Vue.js applications. This pattern helps in managing and scaling Vue projects by encapsulating related components, Vuex stores, and Vue Router configurations into distinct, manageable modules.

## Features

- **Dynamic Vuex Store Registration**: Seamlessly integrate Vuex store modules on-the-fly.
- **Modular Vue Router Configuration**: Dynamically configure Vue Router routes based on modules.

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```
